PerformanceResult class for backward-compatible latency+energy+source tracking.
"""


class PerformanceResult(float):
    """
    Float-like class that stores latency, energy, and a data-source tag.

    Behaves exactly like a float for backward compatibility, but stores energy
    instead of power internally. Power is derived as energy / latency. A
    ``source`` tag records whether the value came from silicon table data, an
    empirical fallback, an explicit SOL estimate, curated exact data, or the
    on-demand overlay. The ``unresolved`` tag is an explicit sentinel and
    dominates addition so composite results cannot hide a descendant miss.

    Supports all arithmetic and comparison operations for full float compatibility.

    Units:
        - latency: milliseconds (ms)
        - energy: watt-milliseconds (W·ms) = millijoules (mJ)
        - power: watts (W) - derived property
        - source: ``"silicon"`` (table data) | ``"empirical"`` (empirical
          formula fallback) | ``"sol"`` (explicit SOL estimate) |
          ``"estimated"`` (modeled from measured components) |
          ``"curated_exact"`` (literal curated row) | ``"overlay"``
          (validated on-demand measurement) | ``"unresolved"`` (an exact
          point is missing) | ``"mixed"`` (sum of resolved values from
          different sources)

    Note: 1 W·ms = 1 mJ. We use W·ms to match latency units (ms).
          To convert to Joules: divide by 1000 (J = W·s = W·ms / 1000)

    Source propagation:
        - ``__add__``: ``"unresolved"`` dominates; otherwise sources merge
          (same -> same; mismatch -> ``"mixed"``), with a zero latency/energy
          value acting as the source identity.
        - ``__mul__`` / ``__rmul__`` / ``__truediv__``: scalar operand has no
          provenance, so the left operand's source is preserved unchanged.
        - ``__abs__``: source preserved.

    Example:
        result = PerformanceResult(10.5, energy=3675.0, source="silicon")
        print(result)           # 10.5 (acts like float)
        print(result.energy)    # 3675.0 (energy in W·ms = 3.675 J)
        print(result.power)     # 350.0 (derived: 3675.0 / 10.5 = 350W)
        print(result.source)    # "silicon"

        # Comparisons work correctly
        if result > 10.0:  # Uses __gt__
            print("Latency exceeds threshold")

        # Aggregation with sum() preserves energy and merges sources
        results = [result1, result2, result3]
        total = sum(results)  # __radd__ handles sum() start value
        print(total.energy)   # Energy is preserved
        print(total.source)   # "silicon" if all were silicon, else "mixed"

        # Sorting works based on latency
        sorted_results = sorted(results)
    """
