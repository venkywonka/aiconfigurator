# AGENTS

This file adds an explicit guard for generator rule edits.

## Required First Step

Before making any change under:
- `src/aiconfigurator/generator/**`

MUST read:
- `.claude/rules/generator-development.md`

## Required Collector First Step

Before adding a Collector operation or changing Collector case population under:
- `collector/cases/**`
- `collector/case_generator.py`
- `collector/model_cases.py`
- `collector/collect.py`
- `collector/registry_types.py`
- `collector/framework_manifest.yaml`
- `collector/*/registry.py`
- `collector/*/collect_*.py`
- `collector/wideep/*/registry.py`
- `collector/wideep/*/collect_*.py`

MUST read and follow:
- `.agents/skills/aic-collector-op-development/SKILL.md`

New operations MUST complete that skill's consumer-contract, case-identity,
deduplication, and validation gates before they are treated as supported.

## Required JIT Resolution First Step

Before adding, reviewing, or changing online JIT/measure-on-miss support for an
existing AIC operation—including operation normalization and resolution hooks,
lazy adapters/runners, `PerfKey` or `MeasurementRequest` construction,
`ResolutionSession` behavior, cold/warm/reopened-overlay gates, or Replay/Spica
callback wiring—MUST read and follow:

- `.agents/skills/aic-jitcollect-op-dev/SKILL.md`

If the same task also changes offline Collector case population or curated perf
data, both this skill and `aic-collector-op-development` apply.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

### Project overview

AIConfigurator is a Python CLI/SDK tool for optimizing LLM inference deployment configurations. See `README.md` for full details.

### Environment setup

Dependencies are managed via `uv` with a `uv.lock` lockfile. The virtual environment lives at `.venv/`. All commands below assume `.venv/bin/` is on PATH or you prefix with `.venv/bin/`.

- **Install/refresh deps:** `python3 -m uv sync --extra dev`
- **Git LFS:** The performance database files under `src/aiconfigurator/systems/data/**/*.txt` are tracked with Git LFS. Run `git lfs pull` after cloning. If LFS pull fails (e.g., `github-cloud.githubusercontent.com` is blocked), the CLI `generate` and `support` modes still work. The `default` mode requires real LFS data.

### Lint / Test / Run

- **Lint:** `ruff check .` and `ruff format --check .` (see `DEVELOPMENT.md`)
- **Unit tests:** `pytest -m unit` (868+ tests; no external deps or LFS data needed)
- **Build tests (PR subset):** `pytest -m "unit or build"` (requires LFS data for the `build`-marked tests)
- **CLI:** `aiconfigurator cli generate --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-32B-FP8 --total-gpus 8 --system h200_sxm` (works without LFS data)
### Known Cloud Agent environment caveats

1. **LFS data:** `github-cloud.githubusercontent.com` may be blocked by network egress restrictions. If `git lfs pull` fails, unit tests and CLI `generate`/`support` modes still work. The `default` mode and `build`-marked tests will fail.
2. **TTY tests:** 4 tests in `tests/unit/cli/test_plain_output.py` may fail because the agent runs in a non-TTY environment.
3. **Rust tests:** `tests/unit/sdk/test_rust_engine_step.py` requires `cargo` with network access to `crates.io`. It will fail if that domain is blocked.
