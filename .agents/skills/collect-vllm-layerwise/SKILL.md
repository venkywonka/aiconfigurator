description: Collect vLLM layerwise latency data with Nsight Systems for AIC layerwise performance modeling. Use when the user asks to collect layerwise data, run the vLLM layerwise collector, gather TP=1/TP=2/TP=8 context or decode layer rows, convert layerwise CSVs into AIC data, or compare AIC/layerwise predictions against FPM ground truth.

# Collect vLLM Layerwise

## Core Workflow

Work from the `aiconfigurator` repo. Use:

- Collector: `python -m collector.layerwise.vllm.collect`
- Parser/common code: `collector/layerwise/common/`
- AIC data target: `src/aiconfigurator/systems/data/b300_sxm/vllm/0.20.1/layerwise_perf.csv`
- Artifact directory: set `AIC_LAYERWISE_ARTIFACTS`; default to `$PWD/.tmp/layerwise-artifacts` when running from the repo.
- HF token: export `HF_TOKEN` directly, or set `HF_TOKEN_FILE` and export `HF_TOKEN="$(tr -d '\n' < "$HF_TOKEN_FILE")"`.
- Model cache: set `HF_HOME`; default to `$HOME/.cache/huggingface` when unspecified.
- vLLM compile/cache directory: set `VLLM_CACHE_HOST`; default to `$HOME/.cache/aic-vllm` and mount it to both `/home/dynamo/.cache/vllm` and `/root/.cache/vllm` in vLLM containers. Also export `TILELANG_CACHE_DIR=/home/dynamo/.cache/vllm/tilelang` and `TILELANG_TMP_DIR=/home/dynamo/.cache/vllm/tilelang/tmp` inside the container so DeepSeek TileLang warmup persists. The `vllm/vllm-openai` image runs as root on this node and writes compile artifacts under `/root/.cache/vllm`. Avoid reusing a mixed/root-owned `$HOME/.cache/vllm` tree unless permissions are known good.

The local Python env may not have vLLM installed. If so, run the collector inside `nvcr.io/nvidia/ai-dynamo/vllm-runtime:1.2.0` and bind-mount host Nsight Systems from `/opt/nvidia/nsight-systems`.
Prefer `NSYS_VERSION=2025.6.3` or newer on B300. If host `/opt` has an older Nsight, check for a newer local install such as `/home/shadeform/tools/nsight-systems-2025.6.3/opt/nvidia/nsight-systems`. Older Nsight builds can export NVTX ranges without CUDA kernel tables, producing zero parsed layerwise rows.

Read [references/layerwise-commands.md](references/layerwise-commands.md) for the canonical Docker wrapper, smoke command, collection commands, conversion rules, and AIC comparison notes.

## Collection Rules

- The vLLM collector simulates TP on one physical GPU by patching model dimensions. It is not a real multi-rank TP deployment, and AIC adds TP communication analytically.
- For TP>1, keep `--rank-reduce max`. Context rows are per simulated rank; AIC adds generic TP allreduce. Decode rows should keep `rms_latency_ms` so AIC can subtract RMS and add fused allreduce+rms when data exists.
- Decode collection defaults to one transformer layer, deployment parity, and batch sizes `1,2,4,8,16,32,64` at KV 1024.
- Use `--live-step-driver` for canonical collection. It preserves scheduler-step timing while avoiding the slow prefix-cache generation path that is especially costly for DeepSeek-V4.
- Context collection defaults to the established production grid with trimmed-mean repeats and prefix-cache past-KV construction. Override `--ctx-new-tokens` and `--ctx-past-kv` only when narrowing or expanding the sweep.
- Context should remain a 2D grid: `new_tokens` up to 8192 and `past_kv` up to 65536, filtered by model max length. Include `new_tokens=8192,past_kv=8192` for vLLM chunked 16k behavior.
- For FP8 checkpoints, do not force KV FP8 unless that is the experiment. `--kv-quant fp8` forces `--kv-cache-dtype fp8`; default vLLM FP8 checkpoint behavior is measured with `--kv-quant bf16` so KV dtype remains `auto`.
- GPT-OSS layerwise specs automatically mirror vLLM's GPT-OSS runtime defaults for FP8 KV cache, CUDA graph capture size, and stream interval. Do not pass real `--tensor-parallel-size` or `--enable-expert-parallel` through layerwise; TP/EP are simulated/added analytically. Context and decode collection use prefix caching to create arbitrary `past_kv` points.

## Step Markers (Span vs FPM/Attribute)

`collector/layerwise/vllm/` has two NVTX step markers, injected via `sitecustomize.py`:

- `vllm_step_marker.py` (`LAYERWISE_STEP_MARKER=1`): the existing single-stream marker for the span-latency layerwise collector above.
- `dynamo_step_marker.py` (`LAYERWISE_DYNAMO_STEP_MARKER=1`): a sibling for the FPM/attribute path, where the worker runs as `python3 -m dynamo.vllm`. It wraps `GPUModelRunner.execute_model` and emits REAL-batch labels (`bench_step::N<step>::bs<decode_batch>::past<mean_kv>`) instead of counter-mode single-stream labels. Pointer only -- the full attributed-FPM workflow lives in the `collect-fpm-ground-truth` skill.

## Smoke Validation

Use the reference smoke command after collector changes. A passing Qwen3-32B TP1 smoke writes four `layerwise.csv` rows, one exported `.sqlite`, one `.nsys-rep`, and four `success` status events. With the default span latency source, `meta.attribution_source=nvtx_span` is acceptable if `attributed_kernels` and per-row `kernel_count` are nonzero. Require CUPTI-backed attribution only when collecting GPU-sum or GPU-capped latency.

## Convert To AIC Data

Map collector CSV rows into AIC `layerwise_perf.csv`:

- `ctx` -> `CTX`, `gen` -> `GEN`
- `attn_tp` -> `tp_size`
- `batch_size` unchanged
- `new_tokens` -> `seq_len_q`
- `past_kv` -> `seq_len_kv_cache`
- Preserve the actual model path in AIC data, e.g. keep `Qwen/Qwen3-32B-FP8` distinct from `Qwen/Qwen3-32B`.
- New collector CSVs include `layer_type`, `measured_layer_count`, and `layer_multiplier`. Treat `latency_ms` as the raw measured representative span; scale by `layer_multiplier / measured_layer_count` when consuming it. Do not separately divide by `target_layer_count` when those metadata columns are present.
- If a full-depth sanity point still leaves a repeatable FPM-vs-layerwise gap, identify a model-general missing component or collector mismatch. Do not add target-model FPM deltas as layerwise prediction inputs.

Run focused tests after code changes:

```bash
uv run --extra dev pytest tests/test_layerwise_vllm_collect.py tests/unit/sdk/database/test_layerwise.py tests/unit/sdk/database/test_data_loaders.py tests/unit/sdk/backends/test_vllm_layerwise_backend.py -q
```
